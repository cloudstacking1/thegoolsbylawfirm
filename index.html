Illegal search and seizure  If law enforcement did not follow proper procedures, the evidence may be inadmissible.
Lack of possession  If the drugs were not found on your person, your attorney could argue that they did not belong to you.
Entrapment  If law enforcement officers coerced you into committing a crime, it could be a valid defense.

</h3>
            </li>
            <p>Even if a conviction is unavoidable, a skilled criminal lawyer can negotiate reduced charges or alternative sentencing, such as drug rehabilitation programs, instead of jail time.
